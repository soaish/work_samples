It tells you how many steps the agent took during that episode (duration). The episode is terminated after about 1000 steps, so if the agent takes more than 1000 steps then it has failed to reach the coin. The max reward is the highest reward received during the episode. The agent receives 100 points for getting the coind, and one point per unit of travel along the x-dimension.

Early on this is because ε is high and the agent is very random. The performance of the agent during training doesn't have a lot of predictive power about how the agent will perform during the next evaluation because ε is set very low (0.1 or less).\n","\n","We do not set `epsilon=0` for testing. This allows for a small amount of randomness during testing. Without randomness, the agent's model would need to be very close to perfect or it will fail to reach the coin. For example, the agent may have learned to crouch or have failed to learn to jump up a ledge, in which case it agent will get stuck. A small amount of randomness means that the agent will occasionally make a move that may get it unstuck by transitioning the agent into a state in which it does know the right thing to do. If the agent relies too much on the randomness to make progress, we will see high durations. If the agent's policy is good the agent will make faster, and more steady progress resulting in lower durations even with some randomness.\n","\n","Here are some of the hyperparamters you might want to change:\n","\n","* ```BATCH_SIZE```: How many replay experiences to run through the neural network at once.

Default is 1000.\n","* ```REPLAY_CAPACITY```: How big is the replay buffer?\n","* ```BOOTSTRAP```: The number of steps the agent should run before training starts. This is to collect up replay experiences. Default is 10000.\n","* ```GAMMA```: The discount factor [0..1]. Default is 0.999, which means incorporate a lot of future utility into the current state's utility.\n","* ```EPSILON```: Probability of using a random action instead of the policy network [0..1]. The default is 0.9.\n","* ```EVAL_INTERVAL```: How many episodes to train before testing the network.\n","* ```TARGET_UPDATE```: One way of stabilizing DQN training is to compute the loss using an old version of the neural network. While counter intuitive that we should train against old information, each update of the neural network can radically change the utility calculations making it hard to find a pattern. This parameter indicates how slowly to update the target network (against which loss is computed). A value of 0 means that the agent should never use old network values. A value of 1+ indicates how many episodes of delay in updating the old network.

or Colab notebooks. Use ```pdb.set_trace()``` to create a break-point with a prompt. Print variables and inspect their values to get a sense of what is going on.\n","\n","**Tensors and their shapes**\n","\n","Tensors can be thought of as multi-dimensional arrays of input or output data for the neural network. They operate very much like regular python arrays and support indexing.\n","\n","Be mindful that your data is in tensors of the correct shapes. A good thing to do is use *pdb* to interrupt execution and check whether your tensor shapes are correct. Use ```tensor.size()``` to inspect a tensor's shape.\n","\n","Sometimes you will need to create new tensors from scratch. Here is a quick cheatsheet:\n","\n","* ```torch.zeros(dim_1, dim_2, ..., dim_n)``` --- This creates an *n*-dimensional tensor filled with zeros.\n","* ```torch.ones(dim_1, dim_2, ..., dim_n)``` --- This creates an *n*-dimensional tensor filled with ones.\n","* ```torch.tensor(array)``` --- This creates a tensor of the same dimensions as a regular python array. For example ```array = [1, 2, 3]``` will create a 1-D tensor, ```array = [[11, 12, 13], [21, 22, 23], [31, 32, 33]]``` will create a 2-D tensor of shape 3 x 3, etc.\n","\n","It is generally a good idea to indicate whether a tensor lives on the CPU or the GPU. The ```DEVICE``` global is set to ```\"cuda\"``` if a GPU is available or set to ```\"cpu\"``` otherwise. When you create a tensor you can indicate where it lives: ```torch.zeros(10, device=\"cuda\")``` or ```torch.zeros(10, device=\"cpu\")``` or ```torch.zeros(10, device=DEVICE)```. You can move tensors from CPU to GPU or vice versa by using ```tensor.to()```.\n","\n","When creating a tensor you might also want to specify the type of data that is being stored. For example:\n","* ```torch.zeros(10, dtype=torch.uint8)``` creates a tensor of bytes.\n","* ```torch.zeros(10, dtype=torch.long)``` creates a tensor of longs.\n","* ```torch.zeros(10, dtype=torch.float)``` creates a tensor of floats.\n","\n","**Tensor slicing and stacking**\n","\n","Generally speaking, you should not have to write any loops. Loops are slow. Tensors can be manipulated in place in parallel.\n","\n","* Slicing: `2d_tensor[0, :]` will get the first column of a 2d tensor\n","* Evaluating: `tensor_x > 0` will create a new tensor of booleans with true whereever there is a positive number.\n","* Stacking: `torch.stack([t1, t2, t3])` will create a new tensor that is made of t1, t2, and t3 stacked on top of each other.\n","* Concatenating: `torch.cat(t1, t2, dim=0)` concatenate t1 and t2 along the zeroth-dimension.\n","* Squeezing and unsqueezing: `t1.unsqueeze(dim=0)` will add an extra zeroth dimension to the tensor. For example `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` will become `[[[1, 2], [3, 4]]]]`\n","* Adding, multiplying, dividing:\n","`t1 + t2`,\n","`t1 * t2`,\n","`t3 / n`.\n","* Maxing, means, etc: `t1.max(dim=1)` will get the max value along dimension 1 (a row). `t1.mean()` will compute the mean value. If there is a mathematical function you want to use, it is probably already built in to torch."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NwsTL1mJHpPu"},"source":["# Download The Model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sSKonDBImXPh"},"source":["This will take a model and make sure it is in \"cpu\" mode so it can run on a computer without a GPU.
