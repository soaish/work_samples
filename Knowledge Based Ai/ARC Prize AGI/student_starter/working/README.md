Welcome to the ARC competition project which you will be working on this semester.

To get started, you'll need a working version of python. I suggest creating a setup
using pyenv (see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer). Although I don't personally
recommend it, you can also use conda (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda).

Once you have a working version of python, you'll need to install jupyter notebooks.
You can do this with the following command: `pip install jupyter`. You can learn 
more about jupyter here: https://jupyter.org

After getting jupyter installed, you can navigate to this project's folder at your command
line and run: `jupyter notebook`. This will launch the jupyter client in your browser. 

Navigate to and open `working/sample_submission.ipynb`. This will be the main file you 
will work on for your project.

You can submit your `sample_submission.ipynb` file to the gradescope portal. You should
be able to submit the sample as-is and it should run successfully and give you a score
of 0. You'll have to do some work to get a higher score :)
