    "      4. Root mean square deviation = square root of 0.00433 which is approximately 6.6%.\n",
    "   3. What the RMSD does is it measures the average deviation of predictions from actual human data for both the models. For the prototype mode, we see the value is 28% which is much higher than the value for exemplar model which is 6.6%. The higher the value, the more the deviation. So, we can say quantitatively, that the exemplar model has a better fit to human data as compared to prototype model.\n",
    "3. The key difference between the models can be seen from 4A and 7A as mentioned in the question - [ 1 1 1 0] and [1 0 1 0]. The prototype model tries to categorize it based on the how close a stimulus comes to a prototype and in that, if we see the prediction ratings for these two examples, the values are almost 50-50, equally split - 61% and 57% probabilities, as if the model is not able to categorize it to the correct one - A. Whereas, the exemplar model has done an excellent job of categorizing it to A with a 80% to 90% probability. Because exemplar model works on the idea of similarity between two items. Even though A is [1 1 1 1] and we know that 4A is a closer item to A than 7A is, but even then, we can see a 80% probability for 4A and 90% for 7A that they are in the category A. This was the case in my results too. Surprisingly, that is also closer to how a human would categorize them based on the test results as provided in the lecture as well as the paper by Medin and Schafer. This pattern suggests that the exemplar model captures how people categorize stimuli better than prototype model because it reflects the fact that human categorization is often instance-based rather than a singular, generalized prototype.\n",
    "4. Both the models Prototype and exemplar have their pros and cons. The prototype model with it's simple flow without parameter runs into cons like less accuracy and less likely to overfit but then again it is not complex enough to capture the way a human might think and process stimuli. On the other hand, with exemplar model, even though it has the 4 parameters that account for its accuracy, it also makes it complex enough to capture the nuanced variations in human cognition. That is also evident from the RMSD exercise we did in the previous answers. To quantitatively generate a report of which model might be better we can use scores like precision, accuracy, f1-score, BIC or AIC values, recall scores that are generally used to evaluate any Machine Learning model. Especially values like Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) might come in handy because they penalize the models for the number of parameters they end up using. For example, Lower BIC values might mean a better balance between model fit and model complexity. Even though, we know for a fact that exemplar model is closer to the human values, the number of parameter used should also mean we get a better model fit based on the BIC values.\n",
    "5. Even though both prototype and exemplar models are good at categorizing binary as well as multi dimensional data as was the case in our experiment, all the data used was linear. The main limitations of the models would arise when dealing with non-linear data. One might think that these models also suck at categorizing outliers but exemplar model is pretty good at categorizing them even though prototype might not be. Humans are more than capable of handling non-linear, complex, dynamic, context-sensitive types of data as well as can deal well with outlier but prototype model might be at a disadvantage. To fix these errors or to tackle them atleast, in the lecture we talked about other models like Rulex model which is a hybrid model to better handle complex data.\n",
